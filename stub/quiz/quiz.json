        "explanation": "Explanation: \n A is incorrect because the parenthesis indicate that b/a will be evaluated first. Since b and a are both integers, the answer will also be an integer and cast to a double too late. C is incorrect because it is casted to an int. D is incorrect because in line 3, b and a are both integers and need to be casted to a double. B correctly casts b to a double, causing the final answer to be a double too."
